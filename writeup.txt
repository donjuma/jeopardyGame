Discussion:
    I've tested this program and determined that most of the functionality is working correctly
    For some reason, the participant is giving a SEGFAULT after reading the answer

Testing:
    I opened multiple TMUX sessions and tested the client connecting to the server. I did
    multiple connections simultaneously and ensured that the server still handled all of them.
    I did my connections on a local machine. I also tested it with a client running on a
    separate machine to our local server.

Challenges:
    The challenges I faced were basic C-isms. Such as using pointer and refferencing, etc.
    Also faced problems with select and writing.
    I had to learn more about getting from standard in
    Mainly string manipulation in C

Variants:
    - Option clear the screen after every round, better ASCII?
    - Option to incorporate both clients into one.
    - Option for first answer wins only
    - Option for multiple channels.
