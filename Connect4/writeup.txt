Discussion:
    I've tested our program and determined that all of the functionality is working correctly.

Testing:
    I opened multiple TMUX sessions and tested the client connecting to the server. I did
    multiple connections simultaneously and ensured that the server still handled all of them.
    I did our connections on a local machine. I also tested it with a client running on a
    separate machine to our local server.

Challenges:
    The challenges I faced were basic C-isms. Such as using pointer and refferencing, etc. Also had
    minor issues with 2 clients together. I had most difficulty with the board analysis in order to
    see if there was a tie or win.

Variants:
    - Option to have the server host a selection of games for each client to choose from and run.
    - Option to keep score and tie it to a certain IP/user for future purposes.
    - Option to play agains the server (AI?)
    - Option clear the screen after every round, better ASCII?
