Discussion:
    We've tested our program and determined that all of the functionality is working correctly.

Testing:
    We opened multiple TMUX sessions and tested the client connecting to the server. We did
    multiple connections simultaneously and ensured that the server still handled all of them.
    We did our connections on a local machine. We also tested it with a client running on a
    separate machine to our local server.

Challenges:
    Getting in contact with each other via canvas messaging proved ineffective and challenging. We ran
    into a bug where we were passing send() the length argument as the size of the variable's address
    (i.e.  &buf) which was being sent as a 64-bit number. However, our input was supposed to be a 32-bit
    int. This caused the program to read the second argument (port number) as the previous guess variable.
    After correcting the length size, we were able to get the program running as intended. This was the
    most challenging aspect because it was really difficult to debug the root of the issue without knowing
    exactly what was triggering the bug.

Variants:
    - Option to have the server host a selection of games for each client to choose from and run.
    - Option to keep score and tie it to a certain IP/user for future purposes.
    - Option to choose the difficulty (via larger sets, or less descriptive responses)
    - Option to have the game played client-to-client with a server just hosting the process.
    - Multiplayer mode. (See who guesses correctly first of the players). Ties in with client-to-client.
    - Or any combination of the above...
